Mining Monitor for Bitcoin

With the default config, it will display GPU load, temperature and fanspeed.
Using the patched ConsoleLogger from phoenix, it will also display your hashrate.

For an example how it looks like, go to 
http://mononofus-dreambox.dyndns.org:8081/

To get the GPU infos, you need pyADL:
https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=8451.0

Put the python files of this monitor (config.py, save_stats.py and 
export_stats.py) in the pyADL directory, so they can use it. graph_stats.py 
will export the graphs directly to .png files and uses more CPU time than 
amcharts. Also, its less shiny ;)

All the files in the amcharts dir should go into some dir of your webserver - 
I recommend nginx. You may need to adjust some paths.

Finally, add the python scripts to your crontab:

# m    h  dom mon dow   command
  *    *  *   *   *     cd /home/mononofu/pyADL && DISPLAY=:0.0 python save_stats.py > /dev/null
  *    *  *   *   *     cd /home/mononofu/pyADL && python export_stats.py -t 4 -r 20 > /var/www/stats/04hour.csv
  */10 *  *   *   *     cd /home/mononofu/pyADL && python export_stats.py -t 24 -r

Of course, change the paths so they fit your system. All paths and settings for 
the python scripts are in config.py
